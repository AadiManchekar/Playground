# Java Programming Concepts

Java is a **statically typed** and **strongly typed** language.

- **Statically typed:** The data type of a variable is known at compile time. This means that you must explicitly declare the type of variable when you create it.
- **Strongly typed:** Type checking is enforced, and it does not allow implicit conversions between incompatible types. If you try to assign a string to an integer variable, Java will throw a compile-time error because the types are incompatible.

## Default Value Assignment

- **Class Member Variables:**  
  Default values are automatically assigned.

- **Local Variables (inside functions):**  
  No default values are assigned; you must initialize them explicitly.

## Types of Variables

### Primitive Types

1. **byte**:  
   - Size: 1 byte  
   - Range: -128 to 127  
   - Default: 0

2. **char**:  
   - Size: 2 bytes  
   - Range: 0 to 65535
    - Default: '\u0000' (null character)

3. **short**:  
   - Size: 2 bytes  
   - Range: -32768 to 32767  
   - Default: 0

4. **int**:  
   - Size: 4 bytes  
   - Range: -2^31 to 2^31 - 1  
   - Default: 0

5. **long**:  
   - Size: 8 bytes  
   - Range: -2^63 to 2^63 - 1  
   - Default: 0

6. **float**:  
   - Size: 4 bytes  
   - Used for single-precision floating-point numbers

7. **double**:  
   - Size: 8 bytes  
   - Used for double-precision floating-point numbers

8. **boolean**:  
   - Represents one bit of information  
   - Default: false

### Reference / Non-Primitive Types

- These include objects, arrays, etc.
- They hold references to the actual data rather than the data itself.
- **Example:** Strings, classes, interfaces, etc.
