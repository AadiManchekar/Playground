# Java Reference Data Types

Java offers several reference data types that are fundamental to its object-oriented approach.

## Main Reference Data Types
1. **Class**
2. **String**
3. **Interface**
4. **Array**

> **Note:** In Java, everything is passed by value. There isn't a concept of pointers as found in some other programming languages.

## Strings in Java

- **Memory Allocation:**  
  Strings are stored on the Heap, and Java maintains a special area known as the "String constant pool" for string literals.
  
- **Immutability:**  
  Once a string is created, its content cannot be changed. Any change creates a new string in memory.

## Autoboxing and Unboxing

Java provides a feature called *autoboxing* that automatically converts primitive data types into their corresponding wrapper classes. The reverse process is known as *unboxing*.

## Access Modifiers in Java

Access modifiers determine the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables. The common access levels include:
- **public**
- **private**
- **protected**
- **default** (no modifier)
